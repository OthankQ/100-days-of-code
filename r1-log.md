### R1D8
Finished 'Responsive Web Design Certification' challenges. Now, time to start the projects.

### R1D9
Completed the Tribute Page project and passed the test for the Survey Form page project. Had to do a lot of research on CSS grid to line up elements in the middle. Will play around with the CSS to make it look better. Time really flew by

### R1D10
Touched up CSS for the survey page project. Might go back to it once in a while to do some more practice with css. Completed the structure for the product landing page.

### R1D11
Passed all the test for the product landing page project. Still having trouble with aligning elements with CSS. 

### R1D12
Felt the need to go over some tutorial for the CSS grid. Now I have a slight sense of what it can do. Will try to create a webpage using grid for the whole layout.

### R1D13
Got into building a practice website using css grid layouts. Also learned how to use CSS variables. Feels like I should have started using it way back.

### R1D14
Completed the grid practice website. Learned lots of stuff about layouts and media queries. Will need to put some practice in by putting them to use in my product landing page project.

### R1D15
Got stuck with writing css for the product landing page project because the video wouldn't move using the css grid. Frustrated, decided to work on setting up a server using express for a newsletter signup page tutorial.

### R1D16
Struggled with destructing assignment JS challenge on FCC. Followed along building a CSS and HTML signup form.

### R1D17
Read the first chapter of "You Don't Know JavaScript" by Kyle Simpson. Tried the first exercise from the book and quickly learned that I need to have a firm understanding of the basics if I want to move forward.

### R1D18
Worked on the You Don't Know JS chapter 1 challenge.

### R1D19
Whipped up a landing page for a business idea me and my friends came up with. 

### R1D20
Read through the first chapter of You Don't Know Javascript and finished the challenge. Not quite satisfied with the result. Read a bit of PHP tutorial.

### R1D21
Started and finished the Technical Documentation Page project on FCC. But barely put any styling into it. Still struggling with CSS layouts.

### R1D22
Finished structuring the html for the portfolio project on FCC. Looking into the Odin Project for more resources. First time contributing to an open source, although it was just a small typo. Kinda excited!

### R1D23
Worked on data structure challenges on FCC.

### R1D24
Coding wise, didn't do much today. Just a couple of javascript challenges on free code camp. Struggled for a while trying to install Xubuntu on a windows virtual machine to set up a Ruby on Rails app. Still struggling.

### R1D25
Finished Combine Arrays with the Spread Operator challenge on FCC. Have yet to successfully install Ubuntu on my desktop. Won't boot for some reason.

### R1D26
Couldn't help but feel like I'm missing some of the fundamentals of programming. Listened to some lectures by Simon Allardice. Great lecturer. Didn't do much of coding today though.

### R1D27
Solved Javascript debugging challenges up to 'Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing'

### R1D28
Read about relational database and went over SQL challenges on codecademy to get a sense of what the language looks like.

### R1D29
Following a tutorial on how to setup a Facebook messenger bot using Node.js and Dialogflow. Currently having trouble with ngrok proxy server. I keep getting 502 bad gateway error. 

### R1D30
Was successful on hooking up my webhook server to the Facebook bot page! Will try to hook up APIs to the bot and see if I can make it do what I want!

### R1D31
Still working on my Facebook messenger bot. But meanwhile, also working on the free code camp JS curriculum. Trying to solve 'Iterating through all array items using for loops.' 

### R1D32
Finished 'Check if an Object has a Property' challenge on free code camp.

### R1D33
Working on 'Basic Algorithm Scripting: Return Largest Numbers in Arrays' challenge on Free code camp. These challenges are taking longer than I thought but feels great when I finally solve them!

### R1D34
Started 'JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts' on Udemy. Learning a lot of things. Can't wait to make my own js framework at end of the course!

### R1D35
More 'JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts' on Udemy. Learned about execution stack and variable environment. Materials look different now that I have dabbled some in Javascript.

### R1D36
Solved 'Finders Keepers' challenge on Free Code Camp and had fun while doing it! Also listened to more of the 'JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts' lecture. Learned about how under the hood, JS is synchronous.

### R1D37
Started working on my portfolio page which I can actually present. Committed by buying a domain name for it too! Also listened to more of the 'JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts'. Went over precedence, associativity and coercion.

### R1D38
Finished the main page of my portfolio site! Now working on the 'about me' section. JS Lecture wise, learned how coercion can lead to interesting behaviors and how some frameworks work around it using || operator, setting default values.

### R1D39
Finished the bio and projects page for my portfolio site! Went over dot notation and bracket notation in 'Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts' lecture.

### R1D40
Finished my portfolio site and deployed it using Github Pages! The contents still needs a lot of work but it felt great to have a site deployed under my own domain name!

### R1D41
Started working on a book list web app where you can just log the name of books, authors and ISBN. This is a tutorial project and I am hoping to learn about classes, event listeners and arrow functions! Also learned about object literals.

### R1D42
Finished the MyBookList app! Learned that there are so many things I actually don't know... yet! Tried nodeschool.io and actually managed to solve a few problems! More JS lectures! Learned that in JS, functions are objects!

### R1D43
Learned quite a lot about 'this' keyword in JS. I learned how 'this' usually refers to the object it belongs to, but when it is in an internal function within a method of an object, it points to global object. Also more about arrays!

### R1D44
Learned about how JS syntax parser works at certain conditions. Also learned about Immediately Invoked Function Expression(IIFE) and why it works the way it does! Took a look inside the V8 engine and its concept before learning Node!

### R1D45
Today I learned about closure in JS I also learned what Node consists of and things JS needs to manage a server!

### R1D46
Learned about closures and how callback functions work! Also learned about call, apply and bind method! Next, I am going to learn about functional programming paradigm!

### R1D47
Today I learned more about functional programming! Function currying, .map() and .filter() method! Also learned a bit about Underscore.js library! This is getting exciting!

### R1D48
Today I learned about prototypal inheritance and how it is different from classical inheritance. The concept is not yet easy to grasp. I hope I can see some good examples! Solved a few OOP challenges on FCC!

### R1D49
Totally forgot to tweet my progress yesterday... Didn't get to do much except solving OOP challenges up to 'Understand Own Properties' on freecodecamp.

### R1D50
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2 â€¦ Read this great article on @Medium and figured what I needed was the ability to breakdown a huge problem into smaller chunks. I actually had fun solving challenges on Coderbyte and FCC today!

### R1D51
Today I worked on some of the katas on @codewars! I also read, learned a bit more about breaking down problems and writing pseudo code. Think I should have done this sooner. I am also actively looking for open source issues on @github!

### R1D52
Today I learned about function constructor and the 'new' operator! I would love to see real life examples of this being used! I also contributed to an opensource project by updating a json file!

### R1D53
I learned about ',prototype' today. Still confused. I might have to go over it again. I am attempting to solve 'Basic Algorithm Scripting: Where do I Belong' challenge on FCC! I was surprised how .filter could make things so much easier.

### R1D54
Finished Simon Allardice's programming foundation course. Basic things but was really helpful for learning general concepts of programming! Coding wise, worked on OOP and Basic Algorithm Structure challenges on free code camp.

### R1D55
Solved functional programming challenges on @freeCodeCamp. Also, started looking at jQuery under the hood to see if I can understand how some of its parts are working.

### R1D56
Working on the React tic tac toe tutorial but still having trouble wrapping my head around it.

### R1D57
Started learning React! I've been staying away from front end of things because of the fear of CSS and general layout problems. But after learning basics of JS, it felt like a good step to learn the JS ecosystem and how frameworks work!

### R1D58
Today I learned how to style React components using CSS and how to embed JavaScript in JSX! Using Scrimba to learn React has been great!

### R1D59
I learned how to style React components with style 'object' within a functional component, and how to use JS to manipulate them!

### R1D60
Learned how to pass in props into React components instead of hard coding information that needs to be rendered!

### R1D61
Today I learned and practiced creating a list of components while passing in properties using .map() method, and rendering those passed in props within different components!
