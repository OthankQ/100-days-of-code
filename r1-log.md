### R1D9

### R1D10
Touched up CSS for the survey page project. Might go back to it once in a while to do some more practice with css. Completed the structure for the product landing page.

### R1D11
Passed all the test for the product landing page project. Still having trouble with aligning elements with CSS. 

### R1D12
Felt the need to go over some tutorial for the CSS grid. Now I have a slight sense of what it can do. Will try to create a webpage using grid for the whole layout.

### R1D13
Got into building a practice website using css grid layouts. Also learned how to use CSS variables. Feels like I should have started using it way back.

### R1D14
Completed the grid practice website. Learned lots of stuff about layouts and media queries. Will need to put some practice in by putting them to use in my product landing page project.

### R1D15
Got stuck with writing css for the product landing page project because the video wouldn't move using the css grid. Frustrated, decided to work on setting up a server using express for a newsletter signup page tutorial.

### R1D16
Struggled with destructing assignment JS challenge on FCC. Followed along building a CSS and HTML signup form.

### R1D17
Read the first chapter of "You Don't Know JavaScript" by Kyle Simpson. Tried the first exercise from the book and quickly learned that I need to have a firm understanding of the basics if I want to move forward.

### R1D19
Whipped up a landing page for a business idea me and my friends came up with.

### R1D23
Worked on data structure challenges on FCC.

### R1D24
Coding wise, didn't do much today. Just a couple of javascript challenges on free code camp. Struggled for a while trying to install Xubuntu on a windows virtual machine to set up a Ruby on Rails app. Still struggling.

### R1D25
Finished Combine Arrays with the Spread Operator challenge on FCC. Have yet to successfully install Ubuntu on my desktop. Won't boot for some reason.

### R1D26
Couldn't help but feel like I'm missing some of the fundamentals of programming. Listened to some lectures by Simon Allardice. Great lecturer. Didn't do much of coding today though.

Solved Javascript debugging challenges up to 'Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing'

### R1D28
Read about relational database and went over SQL challenges on codecademy to get a sense of what the language looks like.

### R1D30
Was successful on hooking up my webhook server to the Facebook bot page! Will try to hook up APIs to the bot and see if I can make it do what I want!

### R1D31
Still working on my Facebook messenger bot. But meanwhile, also working on the free code camp JS curriculum. Trying to solve 'Iterating through all array items using for loops.' 

### R1D32
Finished 'Check if an Object has a Property' challenge on free code camp.

### R1D33
Working on 'Basic Algorithm Scripting: Return Largest Numbers in Arrays' challenge on Free code camp. These challenges are taking longer than I thought but feels great when I finally solve them!

### R1D35
